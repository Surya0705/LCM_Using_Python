# LCM_Using_Python
This is a Python Program that gives out LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) of Two Numbers as Output. Note that No Module is used in this Program, just some basic Maths and Programming. You just need to run the [Main.py](Main.py) file and Enter those two Numbers for which you need to find the LCM. Below is the Screenshot of My Program:
